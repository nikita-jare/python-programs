1. Guess the word:

This program is terminal game which asks user to guess the word by guessing the letters in word in limited chances.

2. Choose random episodes to bingewatch

This program chooses an episode randomly from given directory.
The directory structure is assumed to be as follows:

```

		    |_____ Epsiode 1

         |____ season 3
                    |_____ Episode 1

         |____ season 2
                    |____ Episode 1
